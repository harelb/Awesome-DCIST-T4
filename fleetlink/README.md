# fleetlink

fleetlink is a QoS-aware robot→base-station bridge for the ADT4 scene graph, mesh, robot state and
RViz-style overlays, carried over zenoh. A robot-side **agent** turns ROS topics into compact,
budgeted zenoh messages. A base-side **receiver**, which runs inside the
[ADT4 console](../adt4_console/README.md), mirrors every robot and repairs what got lost.

The wire contract is §8, §11 and §12 of [`adt4_console/docs/API.md`](../adt4_console/docs/API.md),
plus its *Deviations → fleetlink* section.

```

* **`codec.py`.** The shared wire format: msgpack + zstd envelopes
  `{v, robot, stream, seq, epoch, t, p}`, compact columnar node records, graph deltas, and mesh
  tiles (faces bucketed into 8 m cubes, vertices quantised to 1 cm int16). The browser decoder
  `adt4_console/frontend/src/codec.ts` mirrors it.
* **`media.py`.** Occupancy-grid, path and camera-frame payloads: zlib grids, ≤150-point paths,
  and frame conversion to JPEG (OpenCV) or PNG (numpy + zlib).
* **`video.py`.** Live camera video (C5). `VideoStreams` runs one encoder per requested camera:
  the system `ffmpeg` as a subprocess (libx264 Annex-B with an AUD per access unit, or libvpx
  in IVF), raw RGB frames on stdin at the requested fps. `AnnexBSplitter` / `IvfParser` cut the
  output into frames and flag key frames. Without a working ffmpeg the stream falls back to one
  JPEG per frame. `C5Bucket` is the class's token bucket: delta frames need budget, key frames
  may borrow up to one burst, and after a drop a stream skips deltas until its next key frame.
* **`agent.py`.** `AgentCore` keeps "what the base has" (the sent `GraphState`, the sent tile
  manifest, and the sent grid/paths hashes) and on every `tick()` queues only the difference.
  Graph deltas are split to fit the C2 budget, closest to the robot first. Mesh tiles go only
  when their hash changes, and a periodic manifest lets the base detect lost tiles. Payloads are
  built at send time, so dropping or replacing queued items never creates sequence gaps.
  `AgentNode` is the rclpy wrapper: it decodes DSGs on a worker thread (newest only), ticks on
  its own thread, looks up the pose in the DSG frame, and transforms paths into that frame.
  At `frame_align_hz` it also looks up `global_frame` (default `map`) <- the DSG frame (e.g.
  `map -> hamilton/odom`, published by hydra_multi / ROMAN relocalization) and sends it in the
  C1 state as `frame_align {parent, child, T: [x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz], stamp, ok, reason, age_s}`
  (`ok: false`, `T: null` and a `reason` when the lookup fails, i.e. not relocalized; `stamp` 0 =
  static TF). Everything else stays in its native frame; the console applies the transform.
* **`scheduler.py`.** A token bucket per class, drained in strict priority C0 > C1 > C2 > C3.
  Each bucket allows a `burst_s` burst and goes into debt by at most one message, so long-run
  throughput equals the budget. An optional `total_bps` caps all classes together. *Auto* mode
  runs AIMD on the C2/C3 budgets from the receiver's `fb` feedback: multiplicative decrease
  (x0.7, at most every 2 s) when a class's loss (seq gaps) exceeds 5 %, its goodput falls below
  80 % of what was put, or the RTT inflates; additive increase (+10 % of `budget_max`) while the
  class is backlogged and the link keeps up.
* **`receiver.py`.** One mirror per robot. A new `epoch` (an agent restart) clears the mirror and
  requests a resync. C2 is applied strictly in seq order: after a gap the later messages are
  held back and the missing range is asked for with `resend {stream: "dsg", from_seq, to_seq}`
  (served byte-identical from the agent's ring of the last `c2_ring` messages). A lost *last*
  message is found through `seqs.dsg` in the C1 state. After 3 unanswered attempts (2 s or 3 RTT
  each), or when the agent acks "range gone", the receiver applies what it holds and falls back
  to a resync, rate-limited to one per 5 s (deferred, not dropped, when rate-limited). A manifest
  mismatch triggers a `tiles` re-request. A grid/paths hash mismatch that lasts more than 10 s
  triggers a `resend {streams}`. C0 requests are retried until acked; they are queued in an
  outbox and put only after the receiver's lock is released. Pings every second measure RTT and
  clock offset; the `fb` op every second carries goodput, loss (seq gaps per class, also in
  `link()` as `loss` / `lost`) and RTT to the agent's auto mode.
* **`transport.py`.** `ZenohTransport` maps the classes to zenoh priority and reliability; every
  class is congestion-control **DROP** (a must-deliver message on a congested radio stalls the
  whole zenoh transport and then closes it, zenoh #1876), and reliability is the application's
  job (C0 retry, C2 `resend`/resync, C3 manifest). It is a zenoh *client* (a router does not
  forward between peers) that never fails for want of a router: zenoh 1.8 cannot open a client
  session without one, so a failed open is retried on a background thread (puts dropped and
  counted meanwhile, subscriptions declared on open), and an open session reconnects by itself
  after a router restart. `connect` is one endpoint, a list or a comma-separated list;
  `zenoh_overrides` sets any other config path. The config keys it sets (`ZENOH_DEFAULTS`,
  checked against eclipse-zenoh 1.8.0): `connect/timeout_ms: 0`, `connect/exit_on_failure: false`,
  `connect/retry {period_init_ms: 500, period_max_ms: 1000, period_increase_factor: 2}`,
  `transport/unicast/open_timeout: 3000`,
  `transport/link/tx/queue/congestion_control/drop/wait_before_drop: 1000` (µs),
  `.../drop/max_wait_before_drop_fragments: 50000`, `scouting/multicast/enabled: false`,
  `transport/link/tcp/so_sndbuf: 16384`, `transport/link/tx/batch_size: 8192` and
  `transport/link/tx/queue/size/{data_high,data,data_low}: 16`.
  `so_sndbuf` and `batch_size` keep a congested radio's backlog in zenoh's priority queues
  instead of the kernel's TCP send buffer (autotuned to MBs, where C0 waits behind C3:
  head-of-line), and `period_max_ms: 1000` brings C1 back within ~2 s of a long dropout
  ending; both were measured with the fleet harness (see *Tests*).
  The queue sizes: zenoh sends a message larger than one batch as 8 kB fragments, and a DROP
  message whose next fragment finds no free batch in time (zenoh grows that wait 1, 2, 4 …
  ms per fragment, capped at `max_wait_before_drop_fragments` in all) is dropped whole.
  With zenoh's default of 2 batches per priority, every message over ~16 kB (C2 deltas and
  snapshot chunks, C3 tiles and grids, C4 JPEG replies, C5 key frames) was dropped on a busy
  link, and so was its resend. 16 batches (zenoh's maximum) hold 128 kB per data priority,
  so such a message is queued whole; C0/C1 have their own, strictly higher, queues.
  Measured on a 30 kB/s radio saturated by 64 kB grids (fleet harness): every grid and a
  28 kB camera reply (in 1.0 s) arrive, plan→result 1.0-1.6 s, the relayed service 0.8 s.
  Raising `max_wait_before_drop_fragments` does not help: a put blocks the agent's tick
  thread for that long (C1 gaps over 3 s at 2 s) and a 200 kB grid still does not fit.
  The limit that remains: one message over ~128 kB cannot cross a slow radio (30 kB/s) at
  all, and bulk budgets above the link rate keep the data queues full (use `auto`).
  The fleetlink router's json5 sets the same queue sizes, since it re-fragments what it
  forwards (to the base consumers, and base→robot over the radio).
  Publishers are cached per key and class, LRU-capped at 1024 (`undeclare(key)` frees one
  early). A publisher evicted while a put on another thread uses it is undeclared when that
  put returns. `can_send` is only a local in-flight counter (a put of that class still running on
  another thread); the real congestion signal is the receiver's `fb`.
  `LinkEmulator` is two `MemoryTransport` endpoints joined by a simulated radio: bandwidth,
  latency, per-fragment loss, bounded queues and fragment-level strict priority, driven by a
  `VirtualClock` and a seeded RNG, so tests and benchmarks are fully deterministic. Options:
  `block_classes` (model zenoh BLOCK; default none), `backpressure=False` (`can_send` cannot see
  the queue, like zenoh), `tcp_hol=True` (one byte-ordered FIFO for all classes, like a TCP send
  buffer: a big message delays everything behind it) and `close_transport(duration_s)` (drop
  everything queued and in flight, refuse puts for that long, then reopen). Both transports
  implement pub/sub and request/reply (`declare_queryable` / `query`).

## Stream classes

| class | key(s) under `adt4/<robot>/` | zenoh priority, reliability | congestion control | default budget | contents | delivery guarantee |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C0 control | `ctl/req` (base→robot), `ctl/ack` | INTERACTIVE_HIGH, express, reliable | DROP | unlimited | `resync`, `budget {cls: bps}`, `auto`, `ping`, `fb`, `tiles {keys}`, `mesh_lod {level, tiles?}`, `resend {streams}` / `resend {stream: "dsg", from_seq, to_seq}`, `video`, `video_keyframe` | retried every 1 s until acked (`fb`, `ping` fire-and-forget) |
| C1 state | `state`, `paths` | INTERACTIVE_LOW | DROP | 5 kB/s | pose, guards, health, results, stats, `cameras`, `hashes`, `seqs`, `frame_align` at 4 Hz; executor paths on change | latest value; paths re-sent on hash mismatch |
| C2 graph | `dsg/delta` | DATA_HIGH, reliable | DROP | 50 kB/s | snapshot begin/chunk/end, deltas (1 Hz tick) | in order; gap → `resend` from ring → resync |
| C3 mesh | `mesh/tile/<key>`, `mesh/manifest`, `grid/occupancy` | DATA_LOW, best effort | DROP | 100 kB/s | mesh tiles, manifest every 5 s, occupancy grid (checked every 5 s, sent on change) | manifest → `tiles`; grid hash → `resend` |
| C4 media | queryable `media/camera/<name>` | DATA (request/reply) | DROP | 200 kB/s | camera frames on request (`?w=640;q=70`) | none (the caller retries) |
| C5 video | `video/<name>` | DATA_LOW, best effort | DROP | 400 kB/s | live h264 / vp8 / jpeg frames while a `video` request is kept alive | none; a gap requests a key frame |
| C6 store | `store/frame` | BACKGROUND, reliable | DROP | 150 kB/s | image-store frames (`{id, frame_id, prev, blob}`) of the live store mirror | `prev` chain; gap or lost tail → C0 `store {id, after: watermark}` rewinds the agent |

Budgets are **bytes per second**. On the emulated link the transmit order is
C0 > C1 > C2 > C4 > C3 > C5 > C6: an operator waiting for a frame outranks bulk mesh, but not the
graph; the image-store mirror only uses what is left.

### Live image-store mirror (C6)

`store_mirror.py`. The agent tails the robot's hydra image store read-only (`store_path`, default
`$ADT4_OUTPUT_DIR/image_store`) and, **only while sending is on**, sends each new frame (`store_frames`: `keyframes` | `all`)
encoded with `hydra_image_store.transfer.encode_frame` (`store_compression`: `none` | `lossless` |
`fast`) within the C6 budget. The console's receiver writes them into
`<live_store_root>/<robot>/<store_id>/image_store` (default `~/adt4_output/live/...`), a valid store
SAM3 can search. The base tells the agent its watermark (C0 `store {id, after}`) on first contact,
after an agent restart and after a gap, so nothing is lost or duplicated across restarts; a new
Hydra session (store rotation) starts a new mirror directory. Protocol details: console API.md §13.
On a Penn-bag run (`fast`): 64 kB per keyframe, 115 keyframes mirrored at ~61 kB/s.

**Off by default.** The mirror is what fills the radio (5 robots need ~10 Mbit/s with it on), so
the agent starts with sending off (`store_send: false`). The store is still tailed and armed, so
the state shows the backlog. The console's Live link panel has an "Image store" switch per robot
(C0 `store_send {enable}`). The receiver remembers it and asks again when the robot's state
disagrees, e.g. after an agent restart. Turning it off drops queued C6 frames and steps the cursor back
to the last frame sent, so turning it on again continues the chain with nothing lost.

### Lazy cameras

Only `eager_cameras` (default `[rgb, overlay]`) are subscribed all the time. Other `cameras` entries
(e.g. the six Spot cameras, behind lazy image_transport republishers) are subscribed while a C4
query or C5 video request wanted them within `camera_idle_s` (15 s), then released.

### Live video (C5)

The base sends the C0 op `video {camera, enable, fps, kbps, width, codec}` and repeats it at
least every 6 s (`video_keepalive_s`); the console does that every 2 s while a browser watches.
fps 0.5–15 (default 5), kbps 50–2000 kilobits/s (default 300), width default 640 (never upscaled,
aspect kept, even), codec `h264` (default), `vp8` or `jpeg`. Changed parameters restart the
encoder, which starts with a key frame. Key frames come every 2 s (`-g 2*fps`). Frames are sampled
from the newest image the agent keeps per camera (the same one C4 uses), on a dedicated thread so
15 fps is not quantised to the 20 Hz tick. Each frame is one zenoh message
`{camera, codec, seq, t, stamp, key, width, height, fps, data}`; frames are sent as they leave the
encoder, never queued. The C1 state lists active streams under `video`. The encoders, on synthetic
640x360 content for 10 s (`tests/test_video.py`):

| target | h264 (x264 ultrafast, zerolatency) | vp8 (libvpx realtime, cpu-used 8) |
|---|---|---|
| 150 kbit/s, 5 fps | 152 kbit/s | 151 kbit/s |
| 300 kbit/s, 5 fps | 305 kbit/s | 303 kbit/s |
| 800 kbit/s, 10 fps | 834 kbit/s | 816 kbit/s |

Encoder latency is about 25 ms for h264 (the splitter emits an access unit when x264 has been quiet
for 20 ms instead of waiting for the next AUD) and about 10 ms for vp8.

## Parameters

`fleetlink/config/fleetlink.yaml` holds the defaults. Pass another file with `-p config:=FILE`.

| key | default | |
|---|---|---|
| `budgets.{C1,C2,C3,C4}` | 5000 / 50000 / 100000 / 200000 | bytes/s |
| `budget_min`, `budget_max` (C2, C3) | 5000 / 500000, 1000000 | auto-mode clamps |
| `total_bps` | null | optional cap shared by all classes |
| `auto` | false | AIMD on C2/C3 |
| `state_hz` | 4.0 | C1 rate (2 Hz is not enough for < 1 s staleness at 3 % loss) |

| `mesh_decimate_cell` | 0.4 | vertex-clustering cell (m) of the `decimated` mesh LOD; divides `tile_size` |
| `tile_size` | 8.0 | m |
| `mesh_source` | `dsg` | `odometric`: tile Hydra's odometric mesh deltas and send the deformation graph's optimized poses; the base deforms the mesh, so a loop closure costs ~10 kB instead of re-sending most tiles (`docs/MESH_DEFORMATION_DESIGN.md`). Default from `ADT4_FLEETLINK_MESH_SOURCE`. Topics: `mesh_delta_topic`, `mesh_graph_incremental_topic`, `mesh_graph_topic` (Hydra's `hydra/frontend/full_mesh_update`, `hydra/frontend/mesh_graph_incremental`, `hydra/backend/mesh_graph`) |
| `max_msg_bytes` | 65536 | largest C2 message |
| `burst_s` | 1.0 | token-bucket depth, in seconds of budget |
| `grid_period_s` | 5.0 | occupancy grid check period |
| `paths_hz` | 2.0 | executor path check rate |
| `global_frame` (ROS param) | `map` | parent of `frame_align`; "" disables the lookup |
| `frame_align_hz` (ROS param) | 1.0 | `frame_align` lookup rate |
| `budgets.C5` | 400000 | live video, all streams together |
| `video_keepalive_s` | 6.0 | a stream stops without a `video` request this long |
| `ffmpeg` | null | ffmpeg binary (null: `$FLEETLINK_FFMPEG`, `ffmpeg` on `PATH`, `/usr/bin/ffmpeg`) |
| `c2_ring` | 256 | last C2 messages kept to serve `resend` (0: every C2 gap ends in a resync) |
| `budgets.C6` | 150000 | live image-store mirror |
| `store_frames`, `store_compression` | keyframes, fast | C6 frame selection and codec |
| `store_poll_s`, `store_queue_s` | 1.0, 2.0 | store check period; C6 queue depth in seconds of budget |
| `eager_cameras`, `camera_idle_s` | [rgb, overlay], 15.0 | always-subscribed cameras; idle time before a lazy one is released |

Receiver kwargs (base side, `Receiver(...)`): `resend_attempts` (3), `resend_timeout_s` (2.0,
at least 3 RTT), `hold_max` (1024 held C2 messages before giving up on a gap), `fb_period` (1.0 s),
plus `retry_s`, `max_retries`, `resync_min_interval` (5 s), `ping_period`, `resend_grace_s`.

ROS params of `fleetlink-agent` (topics are relative to the robot namespace unless absolute):
`robot_name` (default: the namespace), `config`, `zenoh_connect` (`tcp/127.0.0.1:7447`; one
endpoint or a comma-separated list, retried forever, so the agent starts fine before the router),
`c2_ring`,
`tick_hz` (20), `budget_C1`…`budget_C6`, `store_path` (`$ADT4_OUTPUT_DIR/image_store`, `""` off),
`store_frames`, `store_compression`, `eager_cameras`, `camera_idle_s`, `ffmpeg`, `auto`, `mesh_period_s`, `tile_size`, `grid_period_s`,
`dsg_topic` (`hydra/backend/dsg`), `guards_topic`, `result_topic`, `health_topic`,
`health_monitor_name`, `map_frame` (default: the DSG header frame), `body_frame` (`<robot>/body`),
`fallback_map_frame` (`<robot>/map`), `grid_topic` (`hydra/tsdf/occupancy`),
`smooth_path_topic` / `mlp_path_topic` / `mlp_target_topic` (`spot_executor_node/…_publisher`),
and `cameras` (list of `name=topic`, default
`[rgb=<robot>_zed/rgb/image_rect_color, overlay=semantic_overlay/image_raw]`).

Run it on a robot as the generated sessions do:

```bash
fleetlink/bin/fleetlink-agent --ros-args -r __ns:=/euclid -p robot_name:=euclid -p use_sim_time:=true
```

`bin/fleetlink-agent` re-executes itself in `$ADT4_ENV/spark_env`, which has `eclipse-zenoh`
pinned to rmw_zenoh's zenoh version: `eclipse-zenoh==1.8.0` in `install/spark_requirements.txt`
(rmw_zenoh 0.2.11 / zenoh-c 1.8). The agent logs a warning at startup when the installed
version is not 1.8.x. It also logs which `spark_dsg` it imported and reports DSG decoding
in `state.stats.dsg` (received / processed / failed, node counts, and a `warning` when a payload
that has nodes decodes to none, e.g. a stale spark_dsg shadowing the workspace build). Budgets can also be changed live from the console's
Live link tab (`POST /api/live/{r}/budget`).

## Generic ROS relay (fleetlink mode)

In fleetlink mode each robot's ROS graph stays on the robot, and the ROS topics, services and
transforms that must cross the radio are relayed by fleetlink. They are listed in
[`config/relay.yaml`](config/relay.yaml), whose header documents the schema. Both ends load the
same file.

* **`relay.py`** (pure, no ROS). `RelayConfig` validates the table: it rejects unknown keys,
  modes, directions or classes, a topic or service configured in **both** directions (the loop
  prevention), and two same-direction entries whose platforms overlap. It templates `{robot}`
  (and `{base}` in a service's `base_name`) and filters entries by the robot's topology
  `platform_type`; a robot without one counts as `spot`. `RelayCore` is one end of one
  robot↔base link and runs the delivery modes:

  | mode | behavior |
  |---|---|
  | `reliable` | in order; queue cap 32 (oldest dropped); retried every 1 s, 30 tries; the receiver acks, dedupes and applies in `tseq` order |
  | `latest_reliable` | one pending slot: a newer message replaces the pending retry; the receiver applies only `tseq` above the last applied |
  | `latest` | rate-limited to `rate_hz` (the newest waiting value goes at the next slot), fire and forget |

  `ttl_s` is checked by the sender (it stops retrying) and by the receiver (it rejects with a
  negative ack), using the envelope `t` corrected by the clock offset from the relay's own
  heartbeats. Until that offset is measured (the first heartbeat round trip after link-up or
  a peer restart) the receiver uses the last heartbeat's one-way estimate, and before any
  heartbeat it does not check the TTL at all: the sender's TTL still bounds the retries, and
  a raw `t` would reject everything on machines whose clocks differ by more than `ttl_s`.
  Each end has a random epoch. When the peer **restarts**, only `replay_on_resync: true`
  entries re-send: their pending messages, re-addressed to the new epoch, or with nothing
  pending the last value of a `latest` / `latest_reliable` entry (state, e.g. `/tf_static`).
  A `reliable` entry (events, e.g. action results) does not re-send a message the old peer
  acked, since it was already published there. Everything else pending is dropped, and the
  new peer rejects retries still addressed to the old epoch, so a rebooted robot never re-runs
  a stale plan or pause. That `stale epoch` nack never cancels a pending message: it is how a
  sender may first learn of the restart, and by then the pending was dropped or re-addressed.
  A result applied by the old peer whose ack was lost is re-sent to the new one (at least
  once across a restart of the receiving process). Services use the same request/retry/dedupe
  pattern (`srv/req`, `srv/rep`, never zenoh `get`) and give up after `timeout_s`. A type-hash
  mismatch (ROS 2 `RIHS01`, from the package's generated `.json`) rejects and counts the message.
  The heartbeat carries the config hash, and a mismatch is logged and shown as
  `cfg_match: false`. Everything is congestion-control DROP. Relay messages do not go through
  the agent's scheduler; `rate_hz` is their only budget.
* **`relay_ros.py`.** `RobotRelay` runs inside `fleetlink-agent` on the agent's transport. It
  is enabled with `-p relay_config:=<relay.yaml>` (or `default`), plus optional
  `relay_platform` and `topology`. Without `relay_config` the agent behaves as before. It
  subscribes the `up` topics with `raw=True` and the configured QoS, republishes `down` topics,
  and looks up each configured TF pair (`map → {robot}/base_link`, 5 Hz) in a tf2 buffer.
  `/tf_static` transforms under `frames_prefix` are sent as one message when they change and
  again to a restarted base; a frame that is the child of a composed pair is left out, so it
  never gets two parents. For `dir: up` services (the robot calls, the base answers) it serves
  proxy servers, and for `dir: down` services it calls the robot's real servers.
  `BaseBridge` is the `fleetlink-bridge` node, one process for every robot:

  ```bash
  fleetlink/bin/fleetlink-bridge --ros-args -p zenoh_connect:=tcp/127.0.0.1:7450 \
      -p topology:=<topology.yaml> -p relay_config:=<relay.yaml> [-p base_name:=willow] [-p robots:=euclid,hamilton]
  ```

  Robots come from the topology (`role: robot`) and from any relay heartbeat that arrives. On
  the base graph the bridge subscribes the `down` topics and republishes `up` topics under the
  same names. Transforms go to `/tf`; static transforms go to `/tf_static`, all robots in one
  latched message. The bridge serves proxies for `dir: down` services and calls the real base
  servers (`base_name`, e.g. heracles' `/{base}/update_holding_state`) for `dir: up` ones. It
  publishes `/fleetlink/link_status`: one `std_msgs/String` JSON per robot, at 1 Hz and right
  after a down message is acked. The JSON is `RelayCore.status()`: `connected`, `rtt`, `loss`,
  `last_seen`, `clock_offset`, `epoch`, `peer_epoch`, `cfg_match`, and per topic `sent`,
  `acked`, `pending` and `subs`, the subscribers on the far side when the message was applied.
  The console takes Pause/Resume delivery and robot liveness from this topic. ROS subscriber
  counts mean nothing once the bridge subscribes everything. Both ends spin multi-threaded
  (`relay_ros.make_executor()`, 8 threads): proxy servers block in a reentrant group while
  the far side answers. At most 2 relayed calls per end wait at once (`MAX_PROXY_CALLS`);
  more, or a call while the link is down (`connected: false`), fail at once with the default
  response and a warning, so proxies never take the threads that DSG, TF and pose callbacks
  need. Service clients and publishers are created on the executor thread or before it spins,
  never on zenoh's callback thread.

Inventory notes (`dcist_launch_system/scripts/fleetlink_inventory.py`):
* Nothing on the robot subscribes to `spot_executor_node/pause|resume` yet. They are relayed
  anyway, and the ack's `subs: 0` shows it.
* `omniplanner_node/llm_response` is not relayed (it is base-local).
* `/global/ros_system_monitor/table_in` is one global topic for all robots.

## Fleetlink mode

`network_diagnostics/config/topology.yaml` picks how robots and the base station talk:

```yaml
zenoh:
  port: 7447                              # every machine's own ROS rmw_zenohd
  fleetlink_port: 7450                    # the base's fleetlink router
  fleetlink_networks: [silvus, mit_wifi]  # robot agents try these in order

```

* **`router`** (the default). The base's `rmw_zenohd` connects router-to-router to every
  robot (the endpoints the fleet tools deploy), so all ROS graphs merge across the radio. The
  agent connects to its local router `tcp/127.0.0.1:7447`, and the relay is off.
* **`fleetlink`**. Only fleetlink crosses the radio, and every ROS graph stays on its machine.
  * `generate_zenoh_endpoints()` returns `[]` for every machine, so a zenoh deploy (fleet TUI,
    `fleet-adt4 zenoh`, the launch workflow's phase 0, the console's *Deploy config*) clears
    the base router's robot links.
  * On the base, the `fleetlink_base` window of the `base_station*` sessions starts
    `bin/fleetlink-router` and `fleetlink-bridge`. In router mode both panes only print a
    message.
    * `bin/fleetlink-router [PORT]` runs `rmw_zenohd` with
      [`config/fleetlink_router.json5`](config/fleetlink_router.json5): listen
      `tcp/[::]:7450`, connect to nothing, no scouting, gossip, adminspace or plugins, and
      16-batch data queues (see `transport.py` above).
    * The bridge and the console's receiver connect to it over loopback. The console's
      `--zenoh-connect` defaults to `tcp/127.0.0.1:<fleetlink_port>` when
      `ADT4_FLEET_LINK=fleetlink`.
  * On each robot, the agent connects to the fleetlink router as a zenoh client over the radio
    and runs the ROS relay (`-p relay_config:=default`).

**Environment.** `run-adt4` derives these from the topology unless they are already set
(`python -m dcist_launch_system.fleet_env <machine> [--network NAME]` prints them as shell
exports). Problems such as an unknown machine, or a base with no address on any fleetlink
network, fall back to router mode with a warning and never fail the launch. The fleet launch
workflow passes the launching machine's view of the topology to each `run-adt4` on the
command line.

| variable | robot (fleetlink) | base (fleetlink) | router mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ADT4_FLEET_LINK` | `fleetlink` | `fleetlink` | `router` |
| `ADT4_FLEETLINK_CONNECT` | `tcp/<base silvus>:7450,tcp/<base mit_wifi>:7450` | `tcp/127.0.0.1:7450` | `tcp/127.0.0.1:7447` |
| `ADT4_FLEETLINK_PORT` | `7450` | `7450` | `7450` |

**Failover across networks.** The agent gets all of the base's fleetlink endpoints, in
`fleetlink_networks` order, verified on zenoh 1.8 (`tests/test_fleetlink_router.py`):

* A zenoh *client* opens **one** session, to the first endpoint that answers. When two
  endpoints reach the same router, there is one TCP link and each message arrives once.
* When that link drops, the client reconnects to the first endpoint that answers again.
* It does **not** fail back: once on Wi-Fi, it stays there until that link drops.
* A refused endpoint (router down) is skipped at once. A black-holed one (radio out of range)
  costs zenoh's `transport/unicast/open_timeout` (10 s by default) before the next one is
  tried.

**Switching.** Set `fleet_defaults.fleet_link`, redeploy the zenoh config (in fleetlink mode
this clears the base router's robot endpoints; back in router mode it restores them), and
restart the sessions. To force one machine's mode, export `ADT4_FLEET_LINK` before
`run-adt4`; the other variables are then derived for that mode. Export
`ADT4_FLEETLINK_CONNECT` as well to point a robot elsewhere, such as a bench base.

**Deferred.** Zenoh access control, so that a robot can only put `adt4/<self>/**`.

## Tests and benchmark

```bash
cd fleetlink
zsh -c 'source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.zsh; source ~/dcist_ws/install/setup.zsh; \
        /home/harel/environments/dcist/spark_env/bin/python3 -m pytest -q'
```

* `test_codec`, `test_scheduler`, `test_transport`, `test_agent`, `test_receiver`, `test_media`,
  `test_video` are unit tests. `test_reliability` runs agent + receiver over the emulator with
  every class DROP: C2 gap repaired by `resend` without a resync, "range gone" escalating to a
  resync, a 5 s transport close, `tcp_hol` C1 staleness, and `fb`-driven AIMD converging to the
  link rate with a blind sender. `test_video` runs the real ffmpeg encoders (frame splitting,
  key-frame flags, bitrate within 30 % of target, decodable output) and skips them when ffmpeg
  lacks libx264 / libvpx. They use the `RecordingTransport` and the deterministic `LinkEmulator`
  (latency, bandwidth, loss, congestion, C4 query timeouts and budget).
* `test_zenoh_smoke` (graph, mesh, C0, camera query, grid, paths, live h264 video) and `test_ros_smoke` (a real
  `hydra_ros.DsgPublisher` plus OccupancyGrid/Path/MarkerArray/Image publishers into `AgentNode`)
  start a **throwaway** `rmw_zenohd` on `127.0.0.1:17448` and use private ROS domains (88, 89).
  `test_zenoh_open_without_router_then_connect_and_restart` opens the sessions with nothing on
  `127.0.0.1:17449`, then starts a router there, kills and restarts it.
  They never touch the live router on 7447. They skip when ROS or that port is unavailable.
* `test_relay` exercises `RelayConfig` / `RelayCore` over the emulator. It covers config
  rejection (both directions, unknown mode/key/class) and the platform filter on the real
  `relay.yaml`; reliable order under 30 % loss and the queue cap; latest_reliable supersede; the
  latest rate limit; TTL with a 100 s clock skew and expiry, and with a ±45 s skew before
  the offset is known (and after a peer restart); no replay after a robot restart (with the
  stale-epoch reject); replay to a restarted base (state yes, an acked result no, a pending
  result exactly once, also when its stale-epoch nack is what reveals the restart); type and
  config hash mismatch; service round trips both ways under loss; and service timeouts. `test_relay_ros` runs a
  robot graph (domain 90) with `AgentNode` + `relay_config` and a base graph (domain 91) with
  `BaseBridge`, joined only through the throwaway router. Over that link it checks an
  ActionSequenceMsg down, an `action_result` up, `save_dsg` base→robot, `update_holding_state`
  robot→`/willow/…`, a base-side tf2 lookup of the composed and static frames, and
  `/fleetlink/link_status`. It also checks that the two graphs never see each other, and that
  during a dropout excess relayed calls fail at once while the agent's callbacks and C1 go on.
  Mark: `integration`; `-m "not integration"` skips them.
* `test_fleet_harness` runs fleetlink mode on its real topology, every part a separate process
  (`tests/harness.py`):
  * a base `rmw_zenohd`, `bin/fleetlink-router`, and two robot `rmw_zenohd`, on ports
    17470-17477 and ROS domains 94-96;
  * a real `fleetlink-agent` per robot (relay on) and a real `fleetlink-bridge`;
  * fake robot and base nodes (`tests/harness_nodes/node_host.py`);
  * a `FaultProxy` on each robot's link that can stall, throttle or reset it.

  It checks graph isolation (ROS graph API and liveliness tokens) and the per-robot relay round
  trips. It runs a 30 kB/s link saturated by ~64 kB grids, where every grid and a ~28 kB C4
  camera reply arrive and commands still take under 2 s, a stall
  (`FLEETLINK_STALL_S`, 20 s by default, 60 s per the plan) with no #1876 close, C1 back within
  `FLEETLINK_RESUME_S` and the other robot unaffected, and a fleetlink router kill -9 mid-plan
  with no re-execution. About 50 s in all. Teardown kills every process group and checks that
  none is left. The bench checklist is [`docs/bench_cutover.md`](docs/bench_cutover.md).
* **Benchmark:** `test_integration_pennovation.py` streams the real Pennovation map
  (`/home/harel/data/pennovation_2025/courtyard-alleyways/output/hydra/backend/dsg_with_mesh.json`)
  over an emulated 2 Mbit/s, 150 ms, 3 % loss link. The map is revealed in 20 stages along the
  recorded trajectory, like a robot mapping. The test asserts graph convergence ≤ 60 s after the
  last reveal, full mesh ≤ 600 s, C1 staleness < 1 s, and budget compliance, and prints the
  bandwidth and latency figures:

  ```bash
  python3 -m pytest -q -s tests/test_integration_pennovation.py
  ```

  It is deterministic: same seed, same numbers. It skips when the map file is missing.

## Mesh level of detail

A robot sends its mesh at one of two levels of detail (`codec.MESH_LODS`):

* `decimated`: vertex clustering on a global `mesh_decimate_cell` grid (0.4 m), every vertex of a cell
  replaced by the cell's mean vertex and colour, collapsed and repeated faces dropped
  (`codec.decimate_mesh`, numpy only). The grid divides the 8 m tile size, so neighbouring tiles share
  their border vertices exactly. Pennovation courtyard: 1.62 M -> 0.19 M faces, 13.4 -> 1.8 MB
  (zstd) for the whole mesh, 0.19 s + 0.08 s tiling on a laptop.
* `full`: Hydra's mesh as is.

The base asks with C0 `mesh_lod {level}` (whole mesh) or `mesh_lod {level, tiles: [keys]}` (just
those tiles, e.g. full detail where the operator looks). Each tile carries its `lod` and its hash
covers its content, so a change re-sends exactly the tiles that differ, closest to the robot first,
within the C3 budget; the manifest carries `lod {level, tiles, cell}`. The Receiver asks every robot
for `decimated` when its epoch starts (`Receiver(mesh_lod=...)`, None = never ask) and re-sends the
console's choice (`set_mesh_lod`) to a restarted robot. Compatibility: a robot sends full tiles until
a base asks (an old base never does); an old robot answers the unknown op with an error ack and keeps
sending full tiles (the link status `mesh.lod` is then null).
