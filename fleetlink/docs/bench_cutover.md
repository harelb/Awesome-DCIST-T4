# Fleetlink mode: bench cutover and field acceptance

Bench steps for moving one robot and the base station from **router mode** (all ROS graphs
merged over the radio by `rmw_zenohd` router-to-router links) to **fleetlink mode** (each ROS
graph stays on its own machine; only fleetlink crosses the radio). Background:
[`../README.md`](../README.md), sections *Fleetlink mode* and *Generic ROS relay*.

Before touching hardware, run the multi-router harness. It runs the same topology as separate
processes on one machine, using ports 17470-17477 and ROS domains 94-96, and never touches 7447:

```bash
cd fleetlink
zsh -c 'source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.zsh; source ~/dcist_ws/install/setup.zsh; \
  /home/harel/environments/dcist/spark_env/bin/python3 -m pytest -q -s tests/test_fleet_harness.py'
# the plan's 60 s dropout (default 20 s):
FLEETLINK_STALL_S=60 zsh -c '...same...'
```

## 0. Prerequisites

* **Two machines.** Use the base station (e.g. `willow`) and one robot (or a laptop acting as
  the robot). Do not run both on one host: they would share the ROS router on 7447 and merge
  their graphs. Zenoh would also carry big payloads through shared memory, bypassing the
  network.
* Both machines are on the same commit of `awesome_dcist_t4`, and `fleetlink/config/relay.yaml`
  is identical on both. The heartbeat compares hashes and `link_status` shows `cfg_match`.
* `install/spark_requirements.txt` is installed in `$ADT4_ENV/spark_env`, which provides
  `eclipse-zenoh==1.8.0`. Both machines have the same message packages:
  `robot_executor_msgs`, `heracles_ros_interfaces`, `dcist_launch_system_msgs`. A type-hash
  mismatch rejects messages.
* `network_diagnostics/config/topology.yaml` lists the robot with `role: robot`,
  `platform_type` and its addresses, and the base under `fleet_defaults.fleetlink_base`.
  `zenoh.fleetlink_port` is `7450` and `zenoh.fleetlink_networks` is `[silvus, mit_wifi]`.
* **Robot executor.** A bag session (`spot_bag*`) has no executor, so plans are acked with
  `subs: 0` and no `action_result` comes back. For the plan → result checks the robot needs
  one of:
  * the spot sim executor. No generated session combines `spot_sim` with `fleetlink`. Add
    `spot_sim_fleetlink: {launch_config: [main, spot_sim, fleetlink], config: [default]}` to
    `dcist_launch_system/config_generation/experiment_manifest.yaml` and regenerate (see the
    `adt4-config-generation` skill).
  * the real Spot (`spot-default`).

## 1. Record the router-mode baseline

On the base, run `ros2 node list | sort > /tmp/router_nodes.txt`. Robot nodes such as
`/euclid/...` should appear. This is what fleetlink mode removes.

## 2. Switch the topology

1. Edit `topology.yaml` `fleet_defaults.fleet_link: fleetlink` on **both** machines. To try
   one machine without editing, `export ADT4_FLEET_LINK=fleetlink` before `run-adt4`.
2. Check what each machine will use:
   ```bash
   python -m dcist_launch_system.fleet_env willow    # base: ADT4_FLEETLINK_CONNECT=tcp/127.0.0.1:7450
   python -m dcist_launch_system.fleet_env euclid    # robot: tcp/<willow silvus>:7450,tcp/<willow mit_wifi>:7450
   ```
   For a bench base that is not in the topology, override the robot's endpoint:
   `export ADT4_FLEETLINK_CONNECT=tcp/<bench base ip>:7450`.
3. Redeploy the zenoh config (fleet TUI, `fleet-adt4 zenoh`, or the console's *Deploy config*).
   In fleetlink mode this **clears the base router's robot endpoints**. Restart the base
   `rmw_zenohd`, then on the base check that `ss -tn state established '( dport = :7447 )'`
   shows no robot addresses.

## 3. Start the sessions

**Base** (omniplanner, heracles_state_updater, RViz and the `fleetlink_base` window):

```bash
run-adt4 base_station_heracles-default -n willow -p <prior map>      # RViz base
# or base_station_web-default for the console instead of RViz
```

In the `fleetlink_base` window, pane 1 must print
`fleetlink-router: .../fleetlink_router.json5 (override: listen/endpoints=["tcp/[::]:7450"])`
and pane 2 must log `fleetlink-bridge base=willow cfg=<hash> robots=[...]`. If the panes say
"router mode", `ADT4_FLEET_LINK` was not `fleetlink`.

**Robot** (`spot_sim_fleetlink-default` from §0, `spot-default`, or a bag):

```bash
run-adt4 spot_sim_fleetlink-default -n euclid -s           # sim executor
run-adt4 spot_bag_lc-default -n euclid -s --bag <bag>     # bag: map/TF/state only
```

In the `fleetlink` window the agent must log `fleetlink relay robot=euclid platform=spot ...`.
If the base is unreachable it says `no zenoh router at [...] yet ...; retrying`, which is
harmless.

## 4. What to check

| # | check | how | pass |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | base graph has no robot nodes | base: `ros2 node list` | only base nodes and `/fleetlink_bridge`; nothing under `/euclid/` except topics the bridge republishes (`ros2 topic info -v /euclid/spot_executor_node/action_result` shows the bridge as the only publisher) |
| 2 | robot graph has no base nodes | robot: `ros2 node list` | no omniplanner, heracles or rviz nodes |
| 3 | relay link up | base: `ros2 topic echo /fleetlink/link_status` | `"robot": "euclid"`, `connected: true`, `cfg_match: true`, `rtt` a number |
| 4 | plan dispatch | send a goal (`adt4-sending-goals` skill) | robot executor starts; `link_status` `topics["/euclid/omniplanner_node/compiled_plan_out"]` has `acked` incremented and `subs ≥ 1` |
| 5 | `action_result` arrives | base: `ros2 topic echo /euclid/spot_executor_node/action_result` | one result per action; the planner advances |
| 6 | holding state | robot pick → `/euclid/update_holding_state` | heracles logs the update; the robot's call returns `success` |
| 7 | TF | RViz fixed frame `map` | `euclid/base_link` moves; the static `euclid/*` frames hang under it |
| 8 | RViz plan colors | RViz (`ADT4_RVIZ_CONFIG`, generated fleet config) | the plan path and markers use the robot's topology `color` |
| 9 | console link | console Live link tab / header | robot live, RTT and loss shown; Pause/Resume delivery acked |
| 10 | dropout | unplug or turn off the robot radio for 60 s mid-plan, then restore | no process restarted; C1 state back within ~2 s; the plan is **not** re-executed; results queued during the dropout arrive (reliable, 30 tries, 1 s apart) |
| 11 | no #1876 | grep every pane log and `journalctl` | `Unable to push non droppable` never appears |

A plan published while the link is down is delivered only if it is younger than its TTL (30 s)
when the link returns. An older plan is dropped and counted under `expired`. This is on
purpose, because a stale plan must never run.

## 5. Revert to router mode

1. `fleet_defaults.fleet_link: router` (or `unset ADT4_FLEET_LINK`) on both machines.
2. Redeploy the zenoh config. This restores the base router's robot endpoints. Restart the
   base `rmw_zenohd`.
3. Restart the sessions. The `fleetlink_base` panes then only print "router mode", and the
   agent connects to `tcp/127.0.0.1:7447` with the relay off.
4. On the base, `ros2 node list` matches `/tmp/router_nodes.txt` again.

## 6. Field acceptance (from the plan)

Fleetlink mode becomes the default only when a field run meets all of these:

* no `Unable to push non droppable` in any log over 2 h;
* plan dispatch → `action_result` at the base, p95 < 3 s with 3 robots;
* a radio dropout of 60 s or more recovers without restarting any process;
* the base ROS graph has no robot nodes;
* per-robot radio bytes stay within budget (`fleetlink/config/fleetlink.yaml` budgets, plus
  relay traffic at its `rate_hz`; Silvus telemetry or the console's link stats);
* the console shows each robot's RTT and loss.

## Harness results (2026-10-15, one machine)

* `test_fleet_harness.py`, 5 tests in about 50 s:
  * a 20 s stall: C1 back 0.1-0.3 s after it ends;
  * a 60 s stall: C1 back in 0.13 s, 13 reconnect attempts;
  * the other robot never sees a C1 gap over 0.25 s.
* A 30 kB/s link saturated with C3: plan → result 1.5-1.6 s (0.5 s of that is the fake
  executor), a service call in 0.9 s, C1 gap ≤ 0.6 s.
* Restarting the router with kill -9: the result arrives 3.5-4 s after the kill and the plan
  runs once.
* The zenoh lease (10 s) closes a stalled link and the client reconnects. That close is
  expected; it is not #1876.
